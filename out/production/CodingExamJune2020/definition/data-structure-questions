Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. is a particular way of storing and organizing information in a computer so that it can be retrieved and used most productively.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Basic Operatios on Data Structures:
Insertion − Add a new data item in the data structure .
Deletion − Delete an existing data item from the data structure.
Traversal − Access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed.
Searching − Find out the location of the data item if it exists in the data structure
Sorting − Arranging the data items in some order.​





List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Compiler Design,
Operating System,
Database Management System,
Statistical analysis package,
Numerical Analysis


what is an Array?
An array is a data structure, which can store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type.




what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class.




what is LinkedList?
Linked List is a linear data structure


How is an Array different from Linked List?
An array is the data structure that contains a collection of similar type data elements.
the Linked list is considered as non-primitive data structure contains a collection of unordered linked elements known as nodes.



what is queue?
A queue is a line of things.


what is stack?
A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.



what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO (“First-In, First-Out”) assumes that the oldest products in a company's inventory have been sold first and goes by those production costs.
The LIFO (“Last-In, First-Out”) method assumes that the most recent products in a company's inventory have been sold first and uses those costs instead.



what is the order of complexity?
This means that it is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input, and the algorithm finishes between two factors of it.



what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Input size and elements in array from user.
Input number to search from user in some variable say toSearch .



what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
In the case of sequential search, it is easy to see that if the value is in position i of the array,
then sequential search will look at i values to find it.





what is tree in data structure?
Tree is a hierarchical data structure which stores the information naturally in the form of hierarchy style.


what is graph in data structure?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.






what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap is non synchronized.
It is not-thread safe and can’t be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code whereas Hashtable is synchronized.
HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn’t allow any null key or value.
 HashMap is generally preferred over HashTable if thread synchronization is not needed.



What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS = Array
Network data model = Graph
Hierarchical data model = Trees



How HashMap works in java?
Hashing is the mechanism of assigning unique code to a variable or attribute using an algorithm to enable easy retrieval.






What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access array element with an illegal index.








What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Manually.
Arrays.copyOf()
System.arraycopy()
Object.clone()



What is difference between an array and a linked list?
The difference between an array and a linked list is that an array is an index based data structure,
every element is associated with an index whereas the linked list is a data structure that uses references, each node is referred to another node.







What is DFS and BFS?
BFS stands for Breadth First Search. DFS stands for Depth First Search.
 BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path. DFS(Depth First Search) uses Stack data structure.




What is Recursion?
Recursion is the process which comes into existence when a function calls a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem.




What are linear and non linear data Structures?
In the linear data structure, the data is organized in a linear order in which elements are linked one after the other.
 Conversely, non-linear data structure involves multiple levels.




What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.



Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Algorithm	Time Complexity
  Best	Average	Worst
Selection Sort	Ω(n^2)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
Bubble Sort	Ω(n)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
Insertion Sort	Ω(n)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
Heap Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
Quick Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n^2)
Merge Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
Bucket Sort	Ω(n+k)	θ(n+k)	O(n^2)
Radix Sort	Ω(nk)	θ(nk)	O(nk)


Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
